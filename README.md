# IREP

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/irep/badge/?version=latest)](https://irep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

IREP is a tool that enables mixed-language simulation codes to use a
common, Lua-based format for their input decks. Essentially, the input
format is a set of [tables](https://www.lua.org/pil/2.5.html) -- Lua's
one (and only?) data structure. IREP is an *intermediate representation*
that is used to generate plain-old-data (POD) structures in C, C++,
Fortran, and Lua.

## Documentation

There are some high-level docs here to get you started, but you can find
more in the [full IREP Documentation](https://irep.readthedocs.io/).

## Installation

To build IREP, run `make` in the root directory. This will create
`libIR.a`.  IREP does not (yet) have a proper installation target.

## Building with IREP

IREP has integration for both CMake and gmake-based builds. You can find
more about how to intgrate IREP into your project here:

* [IREP Build Docs](https://irep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html)

There are also example C, C++, and Fortran builds in the `examples/`
directory. You can build and run them all by running `make test`.

## Basics

To use IREP, you can write a header, like this one for defining a
very simple structured mesh. Let's call it `wkt_mesh.h`:

```c
#ifndef wkt_mesh_h
#define wkt_mesh_h
#include "ir_start.h"

Beg_struct(irt_box)
  ir_int(nx, 1)        Doc(( Number of grid cells in 1st dimension ))
  ir_int(ny, 1)        Doc(( Number of grid cells in 2nd dimension ))
  ir_int(nz, 1)        Doc(( Number of grid cells in 3rd dimension ))
  ir_dbl(xmin, 0.0)    Doc(( Location of left-most cell face ))
  ir_dbl(xmax, 1.0)    Doc(( Location of right-most cell face ))
  ir_dbl(ymin, 0.0)    Doc(( Location of nearest cell face ))
  ir_dbl(ymax, 1.0)    Doc(( Location of farthest cell face ))
  ir_dbl(zmin, 0.0)    Doc(( Location of lowest cell face ))
  ir_dbl(zmax, 1.0)    Doc(( Location of highest cell face ))
End_struct(irt_box)

Beg_struct(irt_mesh)
  ir_str(file, FILENAMESIZE, 'none')  Doc(( Name of mesh ))
  ir_int(refinement_level, 0)
  ir_log(amr, false)                  Doc(( Use amr? ))
  Structure(irt_box,box)
End_struct(irt_mesh)

// Declare the structure
ir_wkt(irt_mesh, mesh)

#include "ir_end.h"
#endif  // wkt_mesh_h
```

In IREP, headers like this are called "Well Known Tables", or "WKTs". WKT
headers are includable directly into C and C++ code, and you can refer to
elements of the defined structures like this:

```c
#include "wkt_mesh.h"

void do_something() {
    double xrange = mesh.box.xmax - mesh.xmin;
    double yrange = mesh.box.ymax - mesh.ymin;
    double zrange = mesh.box.zmax - mesh.zmin;
}
```

IREP can also be used to generate Fortran modules and Lua code for WKTs,
and you can refer to their elements in a similarly direct way in those
languages, e.g.:

```
mesh.box.xmax  // C, C++
mesh.box.xmax  -- Lua C
mesh.box.xmax  ! Fortran
```

## Using IREP for input decks

IREP's main use is to allow multi-language (usually C, C++, and Fortran)
integrated codes to read Lua input files ("input decks" for those of use
who've been in the simulation field for a while). With the `wkt_mesh.h`
we've seen so far, we could write an input file like this:

```lua
mesh = {
   file = 'my_mesh',
   refinement_level = 1,
   amr = true,
   box = {
      nx = 100,
      ny = 100,
      nz = 100,
   },
}
```

Note that the `xmin`, `xmax`, `ymin`, `ymax`, `zmin`, and `zmax` fields
in `box` are not defined in the input, but they will take on the default
values from the `wkt_mesh.h` header.

If you want to read this input file from `C`, you could write some code
like this:

```c
#include "ir_extern.h"
#include "wkt_mesh.h"
#include "lua.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    // set up lua and load some lua code
    lua_State *L = luaL_newstate();
    luaL_openlibs(L);
    luaL_loadfile(L, "mesh_example.lua");

    ir_read(L, "mesh");
    printf("mesh.box.xmax = %d\n", mesh.box.xmax);
    printf("mesh.box.ymax = %d\n", mesh.box.ymax);
    printf("mesh.box.zmax = %d\n", mesh.box.zmax);
```

This sets up an embedded Lua interpreter, loads the Lua input file, and
then reads WKT values out of the native Lua tables and into a global
`mesh` structure that can be accessed from `C`.
