# wkt.mk should be included by makefiles that need to build IREP WKT
# libraries.
#
# To build a wkt library, e.g., `libfoo-wkt.a`, simply include this file,
# define a variable `foo.wkt_src`, and add the WKT library as a make target.
# For example:
#
#     include /path/to/wkt.mk
#     foo.wkt_src = wkt_shapes.h wkt_colors.h wkt_numbers.h
#     all: libfoo-wkt.a
#
# The wkt library will be generated and built from the provided WKT headers.
#
# You can need to set some standard GNU Make variables to control how
# WKT libs are generated:
#
#   CC:       Full path to C compiler.
#   FC:       Full path to Fortran compiler.
#   CFLAGS:   Compiler flags for C.
#   FFLAGS:   Compiler flags for Fortran.
#   CPPFLAGS: Flags for the C preprocessor.
#
# It's less likely that you'll need to update these:
#
#   AR: implicitly provided by GNU Make
#   RANLIB: ranlib program (optional)
